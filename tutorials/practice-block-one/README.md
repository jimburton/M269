# M269 Tutorial: Practice Block One

*Dr James Burton, November 2023*

These exercises build on the code and exercises in the M269 Book,
Chapter 6. Familiarity with the ADTs in that chapter and their
implementations in Python, especially that of the *linked list*, is assumed.

## The Set ADT

A *set* is an unordered collection of items with no duplicates. As such,
it is a good choice of data structure if we know that we don't want
any duplicate data. In mathematical notation, sets are shown as a
comma-separated list within braces, e.g. `{1, 2, 3}`.  

Python provides sets as part of its standard library but we are going
to implement our own. Our set ADT supports the following operations:

* We can *add* and *remove* items from a set. When adding items,
duplicates are silently ignored.
* We can query the *size* of a set (also called its *cardinality*).
* We can find out whether a particular object is a *member* of a given
set.
* We can take the *union* of two sets, *A* and *B*, resulting in a
third set, *C*. *C* contains all elements of *A* and *B* (and nothing
else). For instance, the union of the sets `{1, 2, 3, 4}` and `{3, 4,
5}` is `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`.
* We can take the *intersection* of two sets, *A* and *B*, resulting in a third
set, *C*. *C* contains exactly those elements which are in both *A*
and *B*. The intersection of the sets `{1, 2, 3, 4}` and `{3, 4,
5}` is `{3, 4}`.
* We can take the *difference* of a set, *A*, with respect to a second
set, *B*, resulting in a third set, *C*. The difference of the set
`{1, 2, 3, 4}` with respect to the set `{3, 4, 5}` is `{1, 2}`. The
difference of `{3, 4, 5}` with respect to `{1, 2, 3, 4}` and  is
`{5}`.
* We can calculate whether two sets are *disjoint*, which is true if they
  have no elements in common.
* We can calculate whether one set, *A*, is a *subset* of another, *B*. This
  is true if and only if all elements of *A* are elements of *B*. *B*
  might also contain other elements, but it contains at least the
  elements of *A*. 
* We can calculate whether one set, *A*, is a *superset* of another, *B*. This
  is true if and only if all elements of *B* are elements of *A*.
* We can calculate whether two sets are *equal*. This is true if they have
  exactly the same members (remember that order is unimportant).
* We can convert a set to a ordinary Python list.

This ADT is expressed in the file [src/Set.py](src/Set.py).

## Implementing the Set ADT

Get a copy of the code by downloading a zip file from the [home
page](/) of this repository, clicking on the green **code** button. If
you are a git user, cloning the repository is the way to go. This
tutorial can be found within the repository at
[/tutorials/practice-block-one](/tutorials/practice-block-one).

Although there are more efficient ways to do it, we will implement the
Set ADT using a *linked list*, in the style of Section 6.7 from the
book. The first item in a linked list is called `head`. If `head` is
null the list is empty. Each element of one of our linked lists is an
instance of the `Node` class. A node contains an `item`, which is the
data, and a pointer to the next node in the list, called `next`.  To
traverse the list we can start with `head` and keep following the
`next` pointers until they lead to `None`, indicating that this is the
end of the list.

Open the file [src/LinkedSet.py](src/LinkedSet.py) to complete the
exercises. Several of the methods we need to implement are very
similar, or almost identical, to methods in the `LinkedList` class
from Section 6.7 of the book. For instance, finding the size of a
`LinkedSet` is done in the same way as finding the length of a
`LinkedList`, so rereading that section will help if you need
tips. Also, you can see my version of the finished code in the
`solutions` branch of this repository.

The `size` method, in common with many of the others, requires us to
*traverse* the collection. This is done by taking a reference to the
`head` then calling the `next` pointer repeatedly until we reach the
end. This is the pattern:

```python
current = self.head
while current != None:
	# do something
	current = current.next
```

As you complete the exercises, test your work by experimenting with it
in the Python interpreter or by running the tests provided. To run the
code in the interpreter (otherwise called the REPL), navigate to the
`src` directory in a terminal and open an interactive session. Here's
an example of experimenting with the `size` method (note that the
command to run python on my system is `python3`, but yours may be
different):

```
$ python3 -i LinkedSet.py
>>> s1 = LinkedSet()
>>> s1.size()
0
>>> print(s1)
[]
```

To run the automatic tests provided see the [section on testing below](#testing).

1. Implement the `size` method. You can do this by initialising a
   counter then using the pattern above to increment it for every item
   in the set. Finally, return the counter.
2. Use the same pattern to implement the `member` method. If you
   encounter a node whose item is equal to the thing we're looking
   for, return `True`. If you get all the way to the end of the set
   without doing that, the element was not in the list so return
   `False`.
3. Implement the `add` method. Remember, no duplicates are
   allowed. Use the `member` method to check for that. If the new item
   is not a duplicate, make a new `Node` object with `next` pointing
   to the current `head`, then reassign `head` to the new object.
4. Implement the `isdisjoint` method. This should return `True` if the
   two sets (`self` and `other`) have no elements in common. Loop
   through the current set and return `False` as soon as you
   encounter an item which is in the other set.
5. Implement the `issubset` method. This is very similar to the
   `isdisjoint` method except that you want to return `False` as soon
   as you encounter an element which is not in the other set.
6. Implement the `tolist` method. No hints for this one, it should be
   easy :-)
7. Implement the `issuperset` method. Similar to the `issubset`
   problem but in this case we want to loop through the *other*
   set. Note that you **cannot** use the familiar pattern and refer to
   `other.head` -- why? To work around this, convert the other set to a
   list and loop through that.
8. Implement the `clone` method, which creates a "shallow" copy of the
   current set. A shallow copy of a collection, *A*, is one in which a
   new collection, *B*, is created, then references to every element
   of *A* are inserted to *B*. (A deep copy is one in which *copies*
   of the elements of *A*, rather than references to them, are
   inserted to *B*.)
9. Implement the `union` method, where the result should contain all
    elements of both sets. One way to do this is to clone the current
    set then loop through the other set inserting elements into the
    clone.
10. Implement the `intersection` method, where the result should
    contain just those elements that are in both sets.
11. Implement the `difference` method, where the result should contain
    those elements of the current set which are not members of the
    other set.
12. Implement the `remove` method. This one is quite tricky, and I
    advise you to think of two cases: the simple case, where the item
    to remove is equal to the item in `head`, and the more complex
    case where the item to remove is somewhere further on within the
    set. In the latter case you will remove the item by changing the
    `next` pointer of the node *before* the target item to point to
    the node *after* the target item. So, you will need to maintain
    two pointers in your loop: one to the current item and one to the
    previous. If the item to be removed is not a member of the set you
    should raise a `KeyError` like so:
	```python
	raise KeyError("item not found")
	```
13. Implement the `__eq__` method in [src/Set.py](src/Set.py) for
    equality between sets. Two sets are considered equal if they
    contain exactly the same elements, regardless of order. This
    method is implemented in the superclass `Set.py` because it should
    work in the same way whatever the implementation. `__eq__` is a
    builtin method that means we can now use the `==` operator on
    sets.
	
## Testing

Tests are provided in the file
[src/TestLinkedSet.py](src/TestLinkedSet.py). You can read these to
get an idea of how they work, and run them often to check your
progress. The tests are *unit tests*, a standard testing methodology
which isn't covered in this module. If you are using an IDE such as VS
Code, PyCharm or IntelliJ, there is built in support for running these
tests from the IDE. If you aren't sure how to do this we can discuss
it in the tutorial.

Alternatively, you can run the tests from the command line. If you
navigate to the `src` directory in a terminal the following command
runs all tests:

```
$ python3 -m unittest -v TestLinkedSet.Testing
```

You can run a specific test by giving its name. For instance, to run
the first test, `test_add_and_size`:

```
$ python3 -m unittest -v TestLinkedSet.Testing.test_add_and_size
```


## Discussion

1. What is the importance of the `clone` method?
2. What is the time complexity of `member`?
3. What is the time complexity of `intersection`?
4. The fact that our implementation uses a linked list means it is not
   very efficient. Could we use a more efficient data structure to
   implement the Set ADT? Bear in mind that we can't guarantee that
   the objects in our set can be ordered. If we could find a more
   efficient underlying data structure, what would happen to the
   complexity of `intersection`?
