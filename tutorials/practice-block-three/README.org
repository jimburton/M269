* M269 Tutorial: Practice Block Three

/Dr James Burton, March 2023/

** Graphs and traversals.

The following exercises are to give you some extra practice working with graphs, and in
particular with implementing various /traversals/. My solutions are in the
~solutions~ branch of the repository at https://github.com/jimburton/M269.

The exercises below relate to the following sections of the M269 book: Chapters
17 /Graphs 1/, especially 17.7 /Traversing a Graph/ and 17.8 /Breadth- and
Depth-first Search/.

The implementation of the graph ADT in the file [[./src/Graph.py][src/Graph.py]]
is simpler than that in the book (Section 17.6). It stores a set of /nodes/
(also called /vertices/), which can be values of any type, and a set of /edges/,
which are pairs of nodes representing connections in the graph. It is a
/directed/ graph, in that an edge ~(n1, n2)~ is a connection from ~n1~ to
~n2~ and does not necessarily mean there is any connection from ~n2~ to
~n1~. In the latter example we say that ~n1~ is the /source/ of the edge and
~n2~ is its /target/.

#+CAPTION: Figure 1: Visualisation of a graph
[[./slides/graph.png]]

Figure 1 shows a graph with seven nodes labelled 'A' to 'G' and seven edges:
~(A,B)~, ~(A,C)~ and so on. Because no direction is shown along the edges we can
assume this is an undirected graph, so there are also edges ~(B,A)~, ~(C,A)~ and
so on. Because all nodes are reachable by some path, whichever node we start
from, this graph is said to be /connected/.

*** Depth-first traversal

A depth-first traversal begins at a given node, ~n~, then selects one of ~n~'s
neighbours and continues in this way until it reaches a node with no
neighbours, ~p~. It then checks whether the node visited prior to ~p~, ~o~ has any
unvisited neighbours: if it does, it selects one of those and once again continues until
it reaches a dead end. If ~o~ has no neighbours it carries on reversing along
the path it took until it finds a previously visited node that has unvisited neighbours.
If this backtracking takes us all the way back to the beginning node and it has no unvisited
neighbours, the traversal is complete. 

Depth-first traversal can be implemented /recursively/ or /iteratively/ (ie
with a loop). Iterative implementation commonly use a /stack/.

**** Pseudocode for recursive implementation

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
procedure dft_rec(G, v): list
  discovered := empty list
  add v to result
  for all directed edges from v to w in G do
    if vertex w is not in discovered then
      add dft_rec(G, w) to discovered
    end if
  end for
  return discovered
end procedure
#+END_EXAMPLE

**** Pseudocode for iterative implementation

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
procedure dft_iter(G, v): list
  discovered := empty list
  stack := empty stack
  stack.push(v)
  while stack is not empty do
    v = stack.pop()
    if v is not in discovered then
      add v to discovered
    end if
    for all edges from v to w in G do 
      push w onto stack
    end for
    return discovered
end procedure
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Breadth-first traversal

A breadth-first traversal begins at a given node, ~n~ then visits each of ~n~'s
neighbours. It then selects one of ~n~'s neighbours and continues in this way
until it has visited all reachable nodes.

Breadth-first traversal is most often implemented /iteratively/ using a
/queue/.

**** Pseudocode

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
procedure bft(G, v): list
  discovered := empty list
  queue := empty queue
  add v to discovered
  enqueue v
  while queue is not empty do
    w := dequeue from queue
    for all edges from w to x in G do
      if x is not in discovered then
        add x to discovered
        enqueue x
      end if
    end for
  end while
  return discovered
end procedure
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Exercises

Whilst you are working on the exercises you should run the tests that have been
supplied often to check your progress. A suite of unit tests is defined in the
file [[./src/test_Graph.py]]. IDEs like VSCode, PyCharm and others provide good
tooling for unit tests -- easy ways to run them from within the editor. How you
do that will depend on the IDE. Ask for advice in the tutorial if necessary. You
can always run them from a terminal though. First, navigate to the ~src/~
directory. On my system, the command to run python is ~python3~ -- it may differ
on yours. These are the commands to run all of the tests at once or just the
first one:
   
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ python3 -m unittest -v test_Sorting.Testing # runs all of the tests
$ python3 -m unittest -v test_Sorting.Testing.test_sort_basic # runs one of the tests
#+END_EXAMPLE

Implement the following methods in the file [[./src/Graph.py][src/Graph.py]].

+ ~disconnected(self) -> set~: Collect the set of disconnected nodes (those
  which are not part of any edge) in the graph.
+ ~elem(self, n) -> bool~: Returns true if n is a node in this graph, otherwise
  false.
+ ~neighbours_out(self, n) -> set~: Collect the set of nodes that are connected
  to ~n~ by an edge, where n is the source of that edge. Throw a ~LookupError~ if
  ~n~ is not in the graph.
+ ~neighbours_in(self, n) -> set~: Collect the set of nodes that are connected
  to ~n~ by an edge, where ~n~ is the target of that edge. Throw a ~LookupError~
  if n is not in the graph.
+ ~traverse_df_rec(self, n) -> list~~: Implement a recursive depth-first
  traversal of the graph starting at ~n~ using the pseudocode above. Return the
  node labels in a list. Throw a ~LookupError~ if ~n~ is not in the graph.
+ ~traverse_df_iter(self, n) -> list~~: Implement an iterative depth-first
  traversal of the graph starting at ~n~ using the pseudocode above. Return the
  node labels in a list. Throw a ~LookupError~ if ~n~ is not in the graph.
+ ~traverse_bf(self, n) -> list~: Implement an iterative breadth-first traversal
  of the graph starting at ~n~, and returning the node labels as a list. Throw a
  ~LookupError~ if ~n~ is not in the graph.

** Extension: Breadth-first search

With a minor extension this algorithm can be adapted to search for a
particular node, forming a breadth-first /search/ of the graph. The pseudocode
below gives the algorithm for searching for /every/ path from ~source~ to ~target~.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
procedure bfs(G, source, target): <type of labels in G>
  discovered := empty list
  queue := empty queue
  add source to discovered
  enqueue source
  while queue is not empty do
    v := dequeue from queue
    if v == target then
      return v
    for all edges from v to w in G do
      if w is not in discovered then
        add w to discovered
        enqueue w
      end if
    end for
  end while
end procedure
#+END_EXAMPLE

We then need to find the /shortest/ path from source to target.

*Discussion*: How would you go about that?
